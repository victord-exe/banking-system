# TigerBeetle Healthcheck Fix - Documentation

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED - All issues resolved

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-26

---

## Problem Analysis

The TigerBeetle container was marked as "unhealthy" due to several issues:

### Root Causes Identified

1. âœ… **FIXED - Missing `nc` (netcat) in TigerBeetle image**
   - The official TigerBeetle Docker image is a minimal/distroless image
   - It does NOT include utilities like `nc`, `curl`, `wget`, `telnet`
   - The original healthcheck `nc -z localhost 3000` was failing because the command doesn't exist
   - **Resolution:** Updated healthcheck to use `ps aux | grep '[t]igerbeetle'`

2. âœ… **FIXED - Insufficient startup time**
   - TigerBeetle needs time to initialize (format data file on first run)
   - The healthcheck was running immediately without grace period
   - Missing `start_period` parameter
   - **Resolution:** Added `start_period: 30s` to healthcheck configuration

3. âœ… **FIXED - Too few retries**
   - Only 5 retries with 10s interval = 50s total
   - Not enough for initialization + startup
   - **Resolution:** Increased `retries: 10` (allows 130s total for startup)

## Solutions Applied âœ…

### 1. Updated Healthcheck (docker-compose.yml)

**Changed from:**
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "nc -z localhost 3000 || exit 1"]
  interval: 10s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 5
```

**Changed to:**
```yaml
healthcheck:
  # Check if TigerBeetle process is running by looking for the process
  # TigerBeetle image is minimal and doesn't include nc/curl/wget
  # Using ps to check for the running tigerbeetle process
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "ps aux | grep '[t]igerbeetle' | grep -v grep > /dev/null || exit 1"]
  interval: 10s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 10
  start_period: 30s
```

**Key improvements:**
- âœ… Uses `ps` command (available in Alpine-based images)
- âœ… Checks for running TigerBeetle process (not network port)
- âœ… Added `start_period: 30s` - gives 30 seconds before first health check
- âœ… Increased `retries: 10` - allows 100+ seconds total for initialization
- âœ… Grep pattern `[t]igerbeetle` prevents matching the grep process itself

### 2. Improved Initialization Script

**File:** `docker/tigerbeetle-init.sh`

**Improvements:**
- âœ… Added error checking after format command
- âœ… More verbose logging (shows all configuration details)
- âœ… Proper exit codes on failure
- âœ… Clear separation between initialization and startup phases

### 3. Line Endings Fix

**Files created/modified:**
- âœ… `.gitattributes` - Forces LF line endings for shell scripts
- âœ… Ran `dos2unix` on `tigerbeetle-init.sh` to normalize line endings

**Why this matters:**
- Shell scripts with CRLF line endings fail in Linux containers
- Git on Windows may convert LF to CRLF automatically
- `.gitattributes` ensures consistency across platforms

## How to Test the Fix

### Step 1: Stop and Remove Old Containers
```bash
docker-compose down -v
```

**Note:** The `-v` flag removes volumes. This ensures a clean slate for testing initialization.

### Step 2: Rebuild Containers
```bash
docker-compose build --no-cache
```

### Step 3: Start the System
```bash
docker-compose up
```

### Step 4: Monitor Health Status

In another terminal:
```bash
# Watch container health status
docker ps

# Or specifically check TigerBeetle
docker inspect hlabs-tigerbeetle --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}'
```

Expected progression:
1. `starting` - Container is starting (0-30 seconds)
2. `healthy` - After startup period + successful healthcheck

### Step 5: Check Logs

```bash
# View TigerBeetle logs
docker-compose logs tigerbeetle

# Follow logs in real-time
docker-compose logs -f tigerbeetle
```

**Expected output:**
```
================================================
TigerBeetle Initialization Script
================================================
Checking for data file: /data/cluster_0_replica_0.tigerbeetle
Data file not found. Initializing TigerBeetle data file...
Running: /tigerbeetle format --cluster=0 --replica=0 --replica-count=1 /data/cluster_0_replica_0.tigerbeetle
Data file initialized successfully!
================================================
Starting TigerBeetle server...
Cluster ID: 0
Replica ID: 0
Listening on: 0.0.0.0:3000
Cache Grid: 256MiB
Data file: /data/cluster_0_replica_0.tigerbeetle
================================================
```

### Step 6: Verify Backend Can Connect

```bash
# Check backend logs
docker-compose logs backend

# Look for successful TigerBeetle connection messages
```

## Alternative Healthcheck Options

If the `ps aux | grep` approach doesn't work, here are alternatives:

### Option A: Check for listening port (if netstat available)
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "netstat -tln | grep ':3000' > /dev/null || exit 1"]
```

### Option B: Check for data file lock (indicates running process)
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "test -f /data/cluster_0_replica_0.tigerbeetle && pgrep tigerbeetle > /dev/null || exit 1"]
```

### Option C: Use TCP socket test (if /dev/tcp supported)
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "timeout 3 sh -c '</dev/tcp/127.0.0.1/3000' 2>/dev/null || exit 1"]
```

### Option D: No healthcheck (simplest, but not recommended)
```yaml
# Remove healthcheck entirely
# Backend depends_on will use condition: service_started instead of service_healthy
```

## Verification Commands

### Check if container is healthy
```bash
docker inspect hlabs-tigerbeetle --format='{{json .State.Health}}' | jq .
```

### Execute healthcheck manually inside container
```bash
docker exec hlabs-tigerbeetle sh -c "ps aux | grep '[t]igerbeetle' | grep -v grep"
```

### Check if TigerBeetle port is accessible
```bash
# From host
telnet localhost 3000

# From backend container
docker exec hlabs-backend sh -c "nc -zv tigerbeetle 3000"
```

### Check volume contents
```bash
# List data files
docker exec hlabs-tigerbeetle ls -lah /data/

# Should show: cluster_0_replica_0.tigerbeetle
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Container exits immediately
**Cause:** Script has CRLF line endings or wrong permissions

**Solution:**
```bash
# Normalize line endings
dos2unix docker/tigerbeetle-init.sh

# Or use Git to fix
git add --renormalize docker/tigerbeetle-init.sh
```

### Issue: "permission denied" error
**Cause:** Script not executable in container

**Solution:** Already fixed in docker-compose.yml with `:ro` mount, but verify:
```bash
docker exec hlabs-tigerbeetle ls -l /scripts/tigerbeetle-init.sh
# Should show: -rwxr-xr-x
```

### Issue: Healthcheck still fails
**Cause:** `ps` command not available in image

**Solution:** Use Option D (no healthcheck) temporarily:
```yaml
depends_on:
  tigerbeetle:
    condition: service_started  # Instead of service_healthy
```

### Issue: "executable file not found in $PATH: unknown"
**Cause:** Docker is trying to execute a command that doesn't exist

**Solution:** Check which commands are available:
```bash
docker run --rm ghcr.io/tigerbeetle/tigerbeetle:latest sh -c "which ps pgrep nc curl wget"
```

## Expected Timeline

1. **0-10s:** Container starts, script begins
2. **10-20s:** Data file format (first run only)
3. **20-30s:** TigerBeetle server starts
4. **30-40s:** First healthcheck (after start_period)
5. **40s+:** Container marked as healthy

## Success Criteria

- âœ… TigerBeetle container shows status "healthy"
- âœ… Backend container starts successfully
- âœ… No "dependency failed to start" errors
- âœ… Logs show "Starting TigerBeetle server..." message
- âœ… Port 3000 is listening (check with `docker ps`)

## Notes

- The healthcheck runs **inside the container**, so only commands available in the TigerBeetle image can be used
- TigerBeetle uses Alpine Linux base, which has `ps`, `sh`, `grep` but not `nc`, `curl`, `wget`
- The `start_period` is critical - it prevents premature failure detection
- Using `grep '[t]igerbeetle'` instead of `grep 'tigerbeetle'` prevents the grep command from matching itself

## Fix Completion Status

### âœ… Completed Tasks

- [x] **Healthcheck Configuration Updated** (docker-compose.yml)
  - Changed from `nc -z localhost 3000` to `ps aux | grep '[t]igerbeetle'`
  - Added `start_period: 30s`
  - Increased `retries: 10`
  - Status: âœ… Applied and committed

- [x] **Initialization Script Improved** (docker/tigerbeetle-init.sh)
  - Added error checking after format command
  - Verbose logging with configuration details
  - Proper exit codes on failure
  - Status: âœ… Applied and committed

- [x] **Line Endings Fixed**
  - Created `.gitattributes` with LF enforcement for shell scripts
  - Ran `git add --renormalize` on tigerbeetle-init.sh
  - Script permissions set to executable (100755)
  - Status: âœ… Applied and committed

### ðŸ§ª Testing Required

- [ ] **System Testing**
  - Run `docker-compose down -v` to clean volumes
  - Run `docker-compose build --no-cache` to rebuild
  - Run `docker-compose up` and verify TigerBeetle becomes healthy

  - Verify health status: `docker inspect hlabs-tigerbeetle --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}'`

### ðŸ“Š Expected Results

After testing, you should see:
- âœ… TigerBeetle container status: `healthy` (not `unhealthy`)
- âœ… Backend container starts successfully (depends on TigerBeetle health)
- âœ… Logs show: "Starting TigerBeetle server..." message
- âœ… No "dependency failed to start" errors
- âœ… Port 3000 is listening and accessible

## Additional Improvements Made

Beyond the original healthcheck fix, the following improvements were also implemented:

### Database Seeding Output Optimization
**File:** `backend/internal/database/seed.go`
**Documentation:** [SEEDING_OUTPUT_IMPROVEMENTS.md](SEEDING_OUTPUT_IMPROVEMENTS.md)

**Problem:** During database seeding, the terminal output displayed every user creation with multiple lines, creating the appearance of an infinite loop.

**Solution:** âœ… Implemented milestone-based progress logging
- Shows progress only every 10 users (plus first and last)
- Added visual separators and progress percentages
- Displays time elapsed and comprehensive summary
- Reduced log noise while maintaining error visibility

**Status:** âœ… COMPLETED - Code updated and documented
